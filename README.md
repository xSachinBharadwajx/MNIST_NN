# MNIST_NN
The MNIST database of handwritten digits, available from this page, has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. It is a subset of a larger set available from NIST. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image.

## Introduction
MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") is the de facto “Hello World” dataset of computer vision. Since its release in 1999, this classic dataset of handwritten images has served as the basis for benchmarking classification algorithms. As new machine learning techniques emerge, MNIST remains a reliable resource for researchers and learners alike.

In this competition, we aim to correctly identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images. Kaggle has curated a set of tutorial-style kernels which cover everything from regression to neural networks. They hope to encourage us to experiment with different algorithms to learn first-hand what works well and how techniques compare.

DataSource is readily available on Keras. As shown in my code files.
